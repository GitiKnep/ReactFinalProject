# *This is my final project in React.js*
*(To run, first download and run the server file and then the my-app file)*

I created a website for the sale of school supplies, while maintaining a clean code combined with visuals that would be convenient for the user.
First, the user is presented with a login/registration page
(Of course, with appropriate integrity checks).
The user is then transferred to the products page where he can select the products he wants to purchase, add them to the shopping cart and access the payment. If the user typed in an email and administrator password, he will be presented with various options such as deleting and adding products to the site.

**When adding a product, a reduced shopping basket opens with the option to continue shopping or proceed to payment**
